DASH Issues

1. 
Considered to have the manifest or MPEG-4 file leading, USP prefers MPEG-4 file, Akamai and Elemental the Manifest, carefull 
- AP 1 full meta-data (non-media) list e.g. SCTE-35, caption, language, bit-rate boxes, e-message, role/accessability, encryption information
- manifest useful for composition of presentation (authoring), grouping streams etc.
- Preferred to have a real decision, make one leading, and not have a compromise, however caerfull inspection is needed
- for encoder manifest is ok for most workflows (excluding complex multi-camera workflows that have additional meta-data)
note that DRM information can be signalled via  boxes in CENC which is in CMAF and language can be stored in mdhd elng boxes in the MEG-4 file

4. e-msg supported both in DASH and CMAF can help for media processing and meta-data, further study is needed to embed in current spec, this could resolve

5. It was mentioned that this issue is one of the key parts of the spec for media ingest, due to the posting 
it is hard to re-request fragments as is done in client side dash. USP says it sees advantages in short posts
for splice points, for detection of errors but the resending and reasons for failures need be supported. A reason 
could be a missed init segment for example.
AP: define the interaction with short posts and use cases with flow charts etc.

No more time to discuss (end of hour) the additional items, next call will be scheduled sooner due to the significant workload arising
AP. schedule call for end of next week or early in the week after

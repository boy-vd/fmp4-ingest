Notes call 20th of march
Attendants: Will, Patrick, Kevin J, Rufael, Dirk

- Comments on diagram contributed by James -> how to handle 302 
  Why PUT instead of POST -> Rufael thinks because you are overwriting existing manifest
  AP: double check on the PUT usage and 302
- comment on manifest update, why 2 seconds ? answer mainly for events
- discussion on slowness of segment POSTs what if segments arrive in more than their duration/availbility ?
- Dirk: discontinuity on timeline, archive would be ok though
- well time client may get 404 request due to non-avialable segments
- server with some buffering can reduce many of these problems
- discussion on complete information in fmp4 stream (e.g. language, bit-rate, etc) in the fMP4 instead of manifest
    media should always be correct, matching the content, with manifest mcuh parsing and keeping state will be needed, 
    encoders did not object to the approach, but prefer not to have two different approaches for passive and active  
- discussion on use of TCP/HTTP/UDP specifications for transport
ingestion
   AP: ask encoders to support both
  discussion on segement avialability (item 8 on github issue) and what should go in the @media attribute
- narrowing down of the manifest (item 9 on github issue by will law), Will proposes to use one of the DASH interops for this 
- end of call notes to be distributed

agenda
1. discussion on the draft
2. discussion approach for metadata
3. discussion on standardization 

1. discussion on the draft
  MS separate p1 and p2 in separate sections 
  US idea was to deal with technical content first then separate the two sections for p1 and p2
  this idea is ok but it seems the technical part is at a state were we may split the profiles and then
  
MS Comment on point 9 in the general section, resending 412 in case init segment was not received 
seems like it is not needed, as the behavior is to start send the init segment when each TCP connection 
is established, 
-> editors note this assumes long running post connection, what about multiple short running posts ?
   perhaps p1 will go to only long running posts again ? editors note: perhaps semit long running posts is possible.

Restructuring the document 
  ->  outline scenario, workflow, error code etc. AP. Sam to propose a structure for the document
  ->  AP. Rufael restructure the document to a p1 and p2 
  ->  will can contribute later to the sections on the second profile

2. discussion on meta data transport
Discussion on some of the comments from Unified streaming on the azure ingest using smooth ingest on meta data

- Unified Streaming request on usage of standardized boxes based on CMAF or DASH, needs to be checked
- mdat signalling of SCTE-35 was an example in the azure smooth ingest description, 
- azure/smooth also supports the sparse track ingest and delivery to client (smooth)
- unified streaming mentions the use of sparse track for meta-data for ingest as proposed in the draft and azure smooth ingest
- MS ok as long as the content in the mdat is appropriately signalled in the headers
- MS sparse tracks have also been used for other timed metadata like thumbnails 
- US advantage of this approach is that timed meta data handled similar than media and can be muxed
- US overhead of sending metadata in each track is avoided 
- US however in CMAF e-messages are signalled in band in each track
- some discussion on the overhead of requests on the edge for sparse tracks, but the additional load is limited 
  as the content is sparse and only requested, also this content is cacheable quite easily, parent track is used in liveservermanifest
- also the sparse track is mainly used for the ingest protocol under consideration, we prefer not to touch standards like DASH/HLS,
  however sparse track also supported in the smooth streaming protocol
- another advantage is late binding, meta-data is its own track, this is useful for many use cases in broadcasting

3. standards discussion 
 -> some discussion on paths to do the specification work, no clear path chosen yet DASH/IF MPEG or AOM or SVA could be of interest

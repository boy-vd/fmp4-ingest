Live Media Ingest Specification

Todays highly available, highly scalable and high quality video streaming platforms combine high quality live encoders
that perform high quality encoding with video streaming publishing points that handle massive user scalability, personalization, file format conversions, 
personalization and encryption to target all of the different types of end user devices in use. 
Such setups have shown the best results in practical deployments in the most demanding large scale video platforms. 

In such a setup various aspects need to be considered. Best of breed components should be used for live encoder and publishing point 
entities targetting all devices at the best quality and bitrate. Further, to support failover and scalability redundant multiple live encoders 
and publishing point instances are used. These instances should be synchronized, and support graceful start and tear down of instances and streams. 
In addition, many use cases require timed meta data and low latency support.

The new live media ingest specification of a protocol and data format for live media ingest from a live media source such as a live encoder towards a publishing entity will handle each of these requirements. 
This specification will enable lower deployment times and less interop work, and less vendor lock in issues in video streaming platforms.   
This specification will follow common industry best practice and supported formats and will not require dramatic new or complex implementations in 
live encoders and publishing entities.  However, it will enable homogeneous failover, timed meta-data and clock synchronization needed in practical video streaming deployments. 
The vision is that Live encoders should compete based on their encoding quality and performance, not on timed meta data or support for failovers,
which should be homogenized as much as possible. Publishing points should compete based on their scalability and specific features targetting different end user devices.

An industry specification will enable video streaming platforms with easier component interop, better redundancy to failover, better support for timed-meta data, 
best of breed components and less vendor locking issues. Ideally, it will reduce the number of output formats supported by encoders and reduce the number of input formats supported by publishing points.

The media ingest specification work brings together leading companies in the industry, working on an industry specification that will handle each of the following requirements: 

- media ingest specification shall be based on current best practices using existing formats for carriage of media content (e.g. fragmented MP4)
- media ingest specification shall support timed meta data such as based on sparse tracks using SCTE-35 and ID-3 markers, not exclusing any other types of meta data markers
- Media ingest specification shall specify procedures and best practices for live source failover 
- Media ingest specification shall specify procedures and best practices for publishing point failover 
- Media ingest specification shall specify procedures and best practices for gracefull start and stop of live sources
- Media ingest specification shall specify procedures and best practices for gracefull start and stop of publishing points 
- Media ingest specification shall support (implicit) synchronization between live sources and publishing entities
- Media ingest specification shall support low latency services 
- Media ingest specification shall support highest quality codecs and profiles, not excluding lower quality codecs and profiles 
- Media ingest specification shall be standardized and published in an international standards organization (e.g. under ITU/ISO/Internet Society etc.), the choice of this will depend on the choice of consortium partners (TBD)
